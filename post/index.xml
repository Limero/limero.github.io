I then switched to Android and went OnePlus One -&amp;gt; Nexus 6P -&amp;gt; OnePlus 5T. I have now decided that it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to go back.
For the last year, I have been actively working on moving away from Google services. Primarily because I don&amp;rsquo;t trust them. They collect way too much data about its users.</description></item><item><title>The Mystery ThinkPad English EU Layout</title><link>https://limero.github.io/2019/08/24/the-mystery-thinkpad-english-eu-layout/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://limero.github.io/2019/08/24/the-mystery-thinkpad-english-eu-layout/</guid><description>If you live in Europe and order a ThinkPad directly from Lenovo, there are many options for different keyboard layouts. In the Swedish store there are the obvious ones, Swedish, German, UK and so forth. But there is also this mystery English EU/Europe layout with no additional information on what it is. After doing some research, I found out that the layout is the American US layout, but with an additional icon for â‚¬.</description></item><item><title>How I Created This Website</title><link>https://limero.github.io/2019/08/06/how-i-created-this-website/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://limero.github.io/2019/08/06/how-i-created-this-website/</guid><description>Introduction This is an overview of the steps I took to create this website with GitLab pages, Cloudflare and Hugo. It&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be a comprehensive step-by-step guide, but more of a checklist that you can follow if you want a similar website setup.
Getting a domain Getting your own custom domain is entirely optional for GitLab pages as you get a free subdomain at your-username.gitlab.io. It&amp;rsquo;s however highly recommended that you get your own domain to prevent being locked to GitLab.</description></item><item><title>Use RSS for Everything</title><link>https://limero.github.io/2019/07/30/use-rss-for-everything/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://limero.github.io/2019/07/30/use-rss-for-everything/</guid><description>Introduction I used to visit many different websites daily. Websites that all had different layouts without any form of consistency. On some websites, especially Twitter and Facebook, you even have to mentally filter out a bunch of junk every time you visit. It all gets tiring eventually, because it wastes your time.
The solution is to only follow the things that you care about. This is where RSS feeds and a reader comes to the rescue.</description></item><item><title>The American Keyboard Layout Is the Best</title><link>https://limero.github.io/2019/07/28/the-american-keyboard-layout-is-the-best/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://limero.github.io/2019/07/28/the-american-keyboard-layout-is-the-best/</guid><description>My colleagues (Swedish company) occasionally ask me why I use an American US keyboard layout. Most commonly after quickly trying to type something on my computer and it displaying the wrong characters. The answer is simple. It&amp;rsquo;s better for programming. Editors and programming languages simply feel like they are made with and for the American keyboard layout.
The way your fingers have to move to type characters like \ on a Swedish keyboard (you press AltGr and +) is not very intuitive and it feels like an afterthought.</description></item></channel></rss>
